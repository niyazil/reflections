What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
After intializing a repository, a hidden .git folder is created in the
directory. It is needed to store the history of commits of the 
repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains only the files you wish to commit. It allows
more control over version control, as you decide which files are saved.
