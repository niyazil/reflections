When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This would be useful when you want to collaborate on the project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not be ready to incorporatethose changes into your local
version. Maybe the version you have released to the public is not the 
version you want to be using on your own machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a Github copy of an existing Github repository including all branches. A clone is a local copy of a local or Github repository
including all branches. A branch is a copy of a repository up to a certain node in its commit history, after which the histories of the two
branches may diverge. A fork is used to make a copy of someone else's Github repository for which you do not have commiting privelege. The clone can be used to copy repositries, whether they be hosted on Github or locally, to yor local workspace. A branch is needed when you wish to make another version of your project while retaining the original project separately.
