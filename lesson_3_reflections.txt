When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This would be useful when you want to collaborate on the project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not be ready to incorporatethose changes into your local
version. Maybe the version you have released to the public is not the 
version you want to be using on your own machine.
